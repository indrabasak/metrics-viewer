        Metrics</a> data as line graphs. Dropwizard metrics are formerly known as Coda Hale/Yammer metrics. The

    <h2>Adding a Graph</h2>
    <p>
        Before you do anything with the metrics viewer, you have to create a graph by calling one of the
        <code>add</code> methods of the <code>metricsViewer</code>. The type of <code>add</code> method is based on
        the type of metric you are trying to display. The <code>add</code>add method takes following the parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>Id of the HTML division tag where you want the metric graph to be displayed</li>
        <li>Title of the graph</li>
        <li>Description of the graph</li>
        <li>Qualified name of the metric</li>
    </ul>
